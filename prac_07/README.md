## About Me
My name is Alice. I am currently enrolled in the CP1404 Programming II subject, learning new Python programming concepts and techniques.
## Main Lessons Learned about "Clean Code" 
- Creating clear and meaningful names for variables makes it easier to understand the purpose of each variable.
- Maintaining consistent indentation, spacing, and formatting makes code more maintainable.
- Breaking down the code into smaller, reusable functions makes it easier for debugging and testing.
