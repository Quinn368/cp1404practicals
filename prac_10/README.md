# Reflection
1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?

   During the practical tasks, I got better at estimating how long things would take. I learned that when making a program, breaking big problems into smaller ones is really important, especially this can be utilized when facing unexpected issues.

2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

    I found out that there are multiple ways to improve a program through reviews. Additionally, I learned a lot from the feedback and suggestions given by others.
 
3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject? 

    If I were in charge of the subject, I would consider incorporating with the real-world projects to reinforce theoretical concepts and practical skills. Additionally, I would emphasize collaborative learning opportunities such as pair programming and group projects, to enhance teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills among students. 

# Code Reviews
Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.
### [Prac 04 Guitar Test](https://github.com/Ajeetha0701/cp1404practicals/pull/12#pullrequestreview-2026645841)

**Commented:** Having two main functions in a program may not be recommended since it can lead to confusion, naming them as "main_1" and "main_2" may be better.

**Explanation:** Technically, it is possible to have many main functions in a program, however it is not a recommended practice since it can lead to confusion and making your code harder to understand.

### [Prac 06 List Exercise](https://github.com/Ajeetha0701/cp1404practicals/pull/11#pullrequestreview-2026151514)

**Commented:** "Naming variables "a" and "b" may be acceptable, but it is better to develop a more descriptive variable name that can make your code easier to understand."

**Explanation:** It is important to follow the naming conventions when naming variables so that it will not be confusing when referring to which variable in needed.
