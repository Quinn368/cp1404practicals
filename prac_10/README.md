# Reflection
1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?

During the practical tasks, I got better at estimating how long things would take. I learned that when making a program, breaking big problems into smaller ones is really important, especially this can be utilized when facing unexpected issues.

2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

I found out that there are multiple ways to improve a program through reviews. Additionally, I learned a lot from the feedback and suggestions given by others.
 
3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject? 

If I were in charge of the subject, I would consider incorporating with the real-world projects to reinforce theoretical concepts and practical skills. Additionally, I would emphasize collaborative learning opportunities such as pair programming and group projects, to enhance teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills among students.
